          <p>
            BOLDDS is where creativity meets streetwear. We make custom hoodies,
            tees, caps, mugs, notebooks, stickers, and everyday essentials for
            the people who want their style to speak for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you&apos;re a student, a club, a small business, or just
            someone with a vibe — we turn your ideas into clean, wearable,
            aesthetic merch.
          </p>
          <p>
            No mass production. No boring designs. Just identity — printed your
            way.
